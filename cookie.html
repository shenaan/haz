        <p>How we use cookies</p>
        <p>A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once you agree,
            the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular
            site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its
            operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your
            preferences. We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data
            about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this
            information for statistical analysis purposes after which the data is removed from the system.</p>
        <p>Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website by enabling us to monitor which pages you find
            useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about
            you, other than the data you choose to share with us.</p>
        <p>You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can
            usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full
            advantage of the website.</p>
